# CSE423: Computer Graphics

## Course Overview
This course covers fundamental and advanced concepts in computer graphics, including various shape-drawing algorithms, clipping techniques, transformations, projections, color models, and shading techniques. The curriculum also includes a mandatory three-hour lab session every two weeks to reinforce practical understanding.

## Topics Covered
- **Shape Drawing Algorithms**: Line, Circle, Ellipse (using 8-way symmetry)
- **Clipping Algorithms**: Cohen-Sutherland, Cyrus-Beck
- **Transformations (2D/3D)**: Translation, Scaling, Rotation, Reflection, Shear, and transformation matrices
- **Projection**: Converting 3D objects into 2D representations
- **Color Models**: RGB, CMYK, HSV
- **Illumination & Shading**: Various techniques for realistic rendering

## Course Objectives
The primary goals of this course are to:
1. Provide students with an understanding of the graphics pipeline and its fundamental stages.
2. Explain the mathematical foundations behind computer graphics applications.
3. Teach commonly used algorithms in 3D graphics.
4. Introduce advanced techniques and their practical applications.
5. Enable students to apply their knowledge by designing graphics-based projects.
